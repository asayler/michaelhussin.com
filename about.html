					<h1>About</h1>
					<p>
						Michael Hussin has been practicing acupuncture for over thirty years.
						His training has taken him around the world. After first receiving his
						degree at the College of Traditional Chinese Acupuncture in Oxford,
						England, Michael traveled to mainland China in 1982 and again in 1985.
						There he completed a World Health Organization sponsored residency
						program at the Nanjing College of Traditional Chinese Medicine and
						the Nanjing Municipal Hospital.
					</p>

					<p>
						In 1985 Michael helped create in Boston one of the first integrated health care centers in the United States where western trained physicians and acupuncturists worked in a complementary manner.  He practiced in Boston until 1995 when he and his family moved to the Pioneer Valley and, at the invitation of the Hadley Family Practice, joined the Hadley Health Center.
					</p>

					<p>
						In addition to his clinical practice Michael has written and lectured on Chinese medicine in colleges and universities throughout the region.  He has also served on the board of directors of various state acupuncture boards and is President Emeritus of the Acupuncture Society of Massachusetts.
					</p>
 			   
					<p>
						Michael Hussin is licensed and certified by the Massachusetts Board of Medicine.<br>
