					<h1>Herbal Medicine</h1>
					<p>Herbal medicine is the main modality or treatment method within Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). TCM is the world’s oldest, continually practiced, professional medicine. Its written history stretches back not less than 2,500 years and its practice is undoubtedly much older than that. Although acupuncture was the first Chinese modality to gain wide acceptance in the West, Chinese herbal medicine is quickly establishing itself as one of the most popular and effective alternative therapies in the West.</p>
					<p>Empirical evidence has proven that Chinese medicine works for Westerners just as well as for Chinese. Chinese herbal medicine has been used successfully in North and South America, Europe, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and all through Asia.</p>
					<p>In this country most Chinese herbs are taken in the form of pills, capsules, or tablets similar to vitamins and other supplements. Occasionally it is best to take the herbs in liquid form with the proper medicine dose delivered from a dropper bottle into water, juice, or tea.</p> 
					<p>Side effects are minimal to non-existent. If there are side effects they are usually of a mild digestive nature and easily resolved by discontinuing the use of the formula and then talking with your practitioner.</p>
					<p>As with acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine treats the full range of human diseases, from the acute (colds, flus) to the chronic (allergies, gynecological disorders, autoimmune disorders, etc). Chinese herbal medicine is particularly good for promoting the body’s ability to heal and recuperate.</p>
					<p>In Massachusetts, all practitioners must graduate from State approved colleges of Chinese medicine. They then must pass State approved board exams before becoming licensed by the Massachusetts Board of Medicine, the same board that licenses all Western medical physicians.
